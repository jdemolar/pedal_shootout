# TODO

## 1. Catalog views

- [ ] Plugs

## 2. Connections & Cabling (design: `docs/plans/connections-and-cabling.md`)

- [x] **Structured validation types** — Shared `ConnectionWarning`/`ConnectionValidation` types; migrate `powerUtils.ts` to use them (plan: `docs/plans/completed/connections-phase-1-validation-types.md`)
- [x] **Audio connections view** — Signal chain schematic (right-to-left), virtual nodes, stereo pairs, per-item missing-data warnings, placeholder items with configurable jack configs (plan: `docs/plans/completed/audio-connections-phase-2-revised.md`)
- [ ] **Cable routing waypoints** — Hideable cable-path layer over the Layout view (not the Audio schematic view). Full context and existing infrastructure documented in `docs/plans/audio-cable-routing-waypoints.md`. Requires: jack position data per enclosure, port dot placement in Layout view accounting for card rotation, waypoint add/move/remove UI (logic already written — see closed PR #52), length estimation feeding into shopping list.
- [x] **MIDI connections view** — Chain/hub topology, channel assignment, TRS standard detection (TRS-A, TRS-B, Tip Active, Ring Active) (plan: `docs/plans/completed/midi-connections-phase-3.md`)
- [x] **MIDI device settings refactor** — Move MIDI channel and clock send/receive from connection-level to device-level settings (plan: `docs/plans/completed/midi-device-settings-refactor.md`)
- [x] **Control connections view** — Expression, aux switch, CV connections with polarity validation (plan: `docs/plans/completed/control-connections-phase-4.md`)
- [x] **Unified shopping list** — Cable requirements as rows in List tab alongside products, custom cable detection for connector mismatches (plan: `docs/plans/completed/unified-shopping-list-phase-5.md`)

#### Shopping list — deferred improvements

- [ ] **Cable length estimation** — Requires Layout view waypoint data (cable routing); blocked on cable routing waypoints task above
- [ ] **CSV export** — Export shopping list as CSV for offline use
- [ ] **User-editable cable prices** — Allow users to set per-cable-type prices for cost estimation
- [ ] **"Have" checkbox persistence** — Let users mark cables they already own; requires new workbench state field
- [ ] **Backend persistence** — JSONB workbench storage (deferred until user accounts exist)

## 3. Audio / Signal path

- [x] **False cycle detection in loop switcher send/return** — Audio cycle detection falsely flags feedback loops when connecting a pedal in a loop switcher's send/return loop (e.g., RJM Mastermind PBC 10). The cycle detection sees A→B and B→A as a cycle, but send/return is intentionally bidirectional. (plan: `docs/plans/completed/fix-send-return-cycle-detection.md`)
- [x] **TRS multi-connection support for stereo pairs** — A TRS jack can carry two independent signals (tip + ring), but the stereo pair auto-connection logic assumes each connection needs a unique jack on both sides. When one side has a single TRS jack and the other has discrete L/R jacks (stereo pair with shared `group_id`), the same TRS jack should be reused for both connections — one per conductor. This generalizes beyond send/return loops to any TRS-to-discrete-stereo scenario (balanced connections, mixer inserts, etc.). The shopping list should derive "TRS to 2×TS insert cable" when a single TRS jack sources two connections. (plan: `docs/plans/completed/trs-stereo-pair-support.md`)
- [ ] **Signal path validator** — Flag mono/stereo mismatches, impedance issues

## 3. MIDI

- [ ] **MIDI routing helper** — Match controller outputs to MIDI-capable pedals, plan MIDI channel/PC/CC assignments

## 4. Board planning

- [ ] **Pedalboard layout planner** — Visual layout tool combining pedalboards, pedals, power supplies, and plugs (similar to pedalplayground.com)

## 5. Shopping & comparison

- [ ] **Shopping list view** — Display workbench items as shopping list, with has, needs, price, totals, and links to purchase

## 6. UI & UX

- [ ] **Unit toggle** — Enable toggle for units of measurement (mm ↔ inches)
- [ ] **Product images** — Add images to views so users can see the product within the details view (in expanded row panels)
- [x] Make objects rotateable (Layout view — `docs/plans/completed/rotation-z-index.md`)
- [x] Enable objects to be sent forward or back on z-axis (Layout view — `docs/plans/completed/rotation-z-index.md`)
- [ ] Add rotation to PowerView and other planning views (see `docs/plans/options/powerview-rotation.md`)
- [ ] Add z-index ordering to PowerView and other planning views
- [ ] Swap position and style of Manufacturer text and Model text in cards (e.g., "BigSky" at top in white and "Strymon" below in green)
- [ ] Make nav and menu area hideable for increased screen real estate (especially on mobile)

## 7. API

- [ ] POST/PUT/DELETE endpoints (not started — GET-only until explicitly requested)

## 8. Data collection & quality

- [ ] Populate power supply data (ongoing)
- [ ] Populate pedalboard data (not started)
- [ ] Populate MIDI controller data (not started)
- [ ] Populate utility data (not started)
- [ ] Populate plug data (not started)
- [ ] Add `trs_midi_standard` column to `jacks` table — currently the MIDI connections view stores TRS wiring configuration (TRS-A, TRS-B, Tip Active, Ring Active) at the connection level rather than per-jack. Once this column exists, validation can derive the standard from the jack data directly and pre-populate the connection's TRS setting automatically.

### Control connections enhancements

#### Schema gaps

- [ ] **TRS polarity per jack** — Add `trs_polarity` column to `jacks` table (`'tip-active'`, `'ring-active'`, or NULL). Expression jacks have a default polarity that determines compatibility (e.g., Mission Engineering is tip-active, Chase Bliss is ring-active). Currently the Control view stores polarity on the connection, but per-jack data would enable automatic mismatch detection.
- [ ] **Potentiometer resistance** — Add `impedance_ohms` or `pot_resistance_ohms` column to `jacks` table for expression jacks. Pot resistance (e.g., 10K vs 25K Ohm) affects compatibility between expression pedals and their targets. The existing `impedance_ohms` column is intended for audio impedance matching, so a separate column may be needed.
- [ ] **Toe switch type** — Add `footswitch_type` column to `jacks` table (`'momentary'`, `'latching'`) for aux/toe switch jacks. Currently `footswitch_type` only exists on `midi_controller_details`. Expression pedals with toe switches (e.g., Mission SP-25M-PRO Aero) need this data for the Control view to validate switch compatibility.
- [ ] **Independent channel count** — Add a way to represent ganged vs independent expression outputs. Multi-channel expression pedals (e.g., Mission SP-25L-PRO Aero with 3 independent outputs) need to indicate whether channels move together or independently. This could be a column on `utility_details` or a relationship between jacks.

#### Deferred `ControlConnection` fields

- [ ] **`controlledParameter`** — Which parameter on the target device is being controlled (e.g., volume, feedback, mix). Requires parameter assignment UI.
- [ ] **`rangeMin` / `rangeMax`** — Parameter range clamping for expression connections. Limits the effective sweep of the control source.
- [ ] **`auxSwitchAssignments`** — Per-contact function names for aux switch connections (e.g., tap tempo, preset up/down).
- [ ] **`cvVoltageRange`** — Voltage range spec for CV connections (e.g., 0–5V, ±10V).

## 9. MIDI controller guides

- [ ] Add instruction manuals for popular MIDI controllers to provide a guide on pedalboard programming. Although there may be multiple ways of accomplishing various goals with a controller, having a guide can at least recommend solutions when given a specific problem.
- [ ] AI-powered plain-language interface for programming MIDI controllers for desired workflow with specific pedals

## 10. Infrastructure

- [ ] Move app into cloud infrastructure
- [ ] Update node and all packages to newer versions if Docker circumvents macOS limitations

## Data Maintenance Notes (ongoing)

- Regularly verify and update reliability ratings as new sources emerge
- When crowd-sourcing begins, all user-submitted data starts as "Low" until verified
- Cross-reference specifications across multiple sources when possible
- Flag conflicts between sources for manual review
