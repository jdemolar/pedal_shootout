# TODO

## Add tools:

Build the "smart" features:

* **Power budget calculator** - Sum pedal power*current*ma values vs supply capacity
* **Signal path validator** - Flag mono/stereo mismatches, impedance issues
* **MIDI routing helper** - Match controller outputs to pedal MIDI needs

## Add MIDI controller instructions

Add instruction manuals for popular midi controllers to provide a guide on pedalboard programming. Although there may be multiple ways of accomplishing various goals with a controller, having a guide can at least recommend solutions when given a specific problem.
