# Overview

## Purpose

The long-term goal of this project is not only to have a product comparison tool, but to create a tool for planning pedalboard builds. The data about all of the pedals should expand to all pedal-related products, including pedalboards, power supplies, MIDI controllers, etc. so that users can use this tool to help them plan their pedalboard builds.

## Vision

The data collected and stored by this application will be a powerful tool to inform an AI agent so that it can help to plan a pedalboard build. This could be coupled with a tool like pedalplayground.com to also help visualize it. This would ideally enable a more detailed, granular pedalboard plan that takes multiple factors into account:

* Pedalboard layout, including space needed for plugs and cables
* Signal path, including sequence, send/return loops, series/parallel, etc.
* Power requirements
* Control needs (MIDI, CV, USB)
* Cabling, plug types
