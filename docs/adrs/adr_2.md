## Database
SQLite was selected for simplicity and expediency as an upgrade from using Excel worksheets for storing data. However, it is a transitional architectural decision and another database solution will be decided in the future.

PostgreSQL will be the target solution. Migration to Postgres is TBD.

## API
The API will be built using Java with Spring Boot.

## Infrastructure
Currently building locally. Plan to move into AWS as the project grows and matures to be production-ready.

## Web App
Currently in ReactJS and plan to keep there.
